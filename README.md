## Lyrics

Look at the stars,  
Look how they shine for you,  
And everything you do,  
Yeah, they were all yellow.  

I came along,  
I wrote a ```code``` for you,  
And all the things you do,  
And it was called "Yellow".  
.  
.  
.  

It's true,  
Look how they shine for you,  
Look how they shine for you,  
Look how they shine for,  
Look how they shine for you,  
Look how they shine for you,  
Look how they shine.

Look at the stars,  
Look how they shine for you,  
And all the things that you do.
